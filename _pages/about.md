I am a fourth-year PhD student in the [ECE Department](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I am fortunate to be co-advised by [Peter Steenkiste](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~prs/) and [Vyas Sekar](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~vsekar/). Prior to CMU, I received a BS degree in Computer Science from KAIST. My research interests lie in the intersection of network monitoring and programmable hardware devices.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
