I received my Ph.D. in Jan 2023 in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). I was fortunated to be co-advised by [Peter Steenkiste](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~prs/) and [Vyas Sekar](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~vsekar/). Prior to CMU, I received a BS degree in Computer Science from KAIST. My research interests lie in the intersection of network monitoring and programmable hardware devices. Now I'm a software engineer at **Google**.

I am married to [Saerom Park](https://srompark.github.io/).



<!-- **I’m currently on the job market!** I’m looking for an industry position where I can have hands-on experience on large-scale (network) systems. My interests are network measurements and/or programmable network devices. -->

<!-- It's even better 

a US-based tech company where I can learn new things, tackle challenging problems, and build hyper-scale systems that have a real-world impact. Feel free to contact me! -->

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
